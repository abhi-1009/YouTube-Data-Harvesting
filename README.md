# Guvi_CAPSTON_Project_YOUTUBE-DATA-HARVESTING-AND-WAREHOUSING

Introduction
Youtube-Data-Harvesting-And-Warehousing YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing is a project that intends to provide users with the ability to access and analyse data from numerous YouTube channels. SQL and Streamlit are used in the project to develop a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube channel and video data.

Project Overview

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project consists of the following components:

STREAMLIT: Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.

PYTHON: Python is a powerful programming language renowned for being easy to learn and understand. Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.

GOOGLE API CLIENT: The googleapiclient library in Python facilitates the communication with different Google APIs. Its primary purpose in this project is to interact with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information like channel details, video specifics, and comments. By utilizing googleapiclient, developers can easily access and manipulate YouTube's extensive data resources through code.

YOUTUBE DATA SCRAPPING AND ITS ETHICAL PERSPECTIVE: When engaging in the scraping of YouTube content, it is crucial to approach it ethically and responsibly. Respecting YouTube's terms and conditions, obtaining appropriate authorization, and adhering to data protection regulations are fundamental considerations. The collected data must be handled responsibly, ensuring privacy, confidentiality, and preventing any form of misuse or misrepresentation. Furthermore, it is important to take into account the potential impact on the platform and its community, striving for a fair and sustainable scraping process. By following these ethical guidelines, we can uphold integrity while extracting valuable insights from YouTube data.

Technologies Used

The following technologies are used in this project:

1.Python: The programming language used for building the application and scripting tasks.
2.Streamlit: A Python library used for creating interactive web applications and data visualizations.
3.YouTube API: Google API is used to retrieve channel and video data from YouTube.
4.SQL (MySQL): A relational database used as a data warehouse for storing migrated YouTube data.
5.Pandas: A data manipulation library used for data processing and analysis.

Installation and Setup

To run the YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project, follow these steps:

1.Install Python: Install the Python programming language on your machine.
2.Install Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip or conda package manager. Required libraries include Streamlit, Pandas.
3.Set Up Google API: Set up a Google API project and obtain the necessary API credentials for accessing the YouTube API.
4.Configure Database: Set up a SQL database (MySQL) for storing the data.
5.Configure Application: Update the configuration file or environment variables with the necessary API credentials and database connection details.
6.Run the Application: Launch the Streamlit application using the command-line interface.

Usage

Once the project is setup and running, users can access the Streamlit application through a web browser. The application will provide a user interface where users can perform the following actions:

1.Enter a YouTube channel ID to retrieve data for that channel.
2.Collect and store data for multiple YouTube channels.
3.Select a channel and migrate its data to the SQL data warehouse.
4.Search and retrieve data from the SQL database using various search options.

Features

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing application offers the following features:

1.Retrieval of channel and video data from YouTube using the YouTube API.
2.Migration of data to a SQL database for efficient querying and analysis.
3.Search and retrieval of data from the SQL database using different search options, including joining tables.
4.Support for handling multiple YouTube channels and managing their data.

Conclusion

The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project provides a powerful tool for retrieving, storing, and analyzing YouTube channel and video data. By leveraging SQL and Streamlit, users can easily access and manipulate YouTube data in a user-friendly interface. The project offers flexibility, scalability,and empowering users to gain insights from the vast amount of YouTube data available.
